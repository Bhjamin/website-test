                <p class="text-[#58585B]">We, or our advertising providers, automatically deliver ads to all users on the Alder Web Services, whether the users are registered or not, based on non-PII including: (i) the IP address associated with your device for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location; (ii) the type of web page being displayed, e.g. news or sports page; or (iii) the content on the page shown, e.g. a sports article or movie review.

                <p class="text-[#58585B]">If you are a registered user, Alder, or service providers acting at Alder’s request, may use Your Data, regardless of where we gathered such information, to determine what type of ad to display to you on the Alder Web Services and other websites.

                <p class="text-[#58585B]">The advertising networks and/or content providers that deliver ads on the Alder Web Services may use technologies such as HTTP cookies, Flash cookies, and HTML5 local storage to uniquely distinguish your web browser and keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of ads shown and the web pages on which the ads appeared.

                <p class="text-[#58585B]">Alder uses industry standard approaches to securely store, control access to, and make appropriate use of Your Data, and we require our contractors and other providers to do so as well.

If you don’t want Alder to know any particular information about you, you should not register to use the Alder Web Services or include it in anything that you submit to Alder.</p>

                <p class="text-[#58585B]">Alder also takes additional steps to increase the security and reliability of customer communications. We do not read your outgoing or incoming email, file attachments, video mail, private chat, or instant messages. However, we (along with our third-party providers) use software and hardware tools to help prevent and block “spam” emails, viruses, spyware, and other harmful or unwanted communications and programs from being sent and received. These tools may automatically scan your emails, video mails, instant messages, file attachments, and other files and communications in order to help us protect you and the Web Services against these harmful or unwanted communications and programs.</p>

                <p class="text-[#58585B]">We follow generally-accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and after we receive it. Please remember that no method of transmission of any information over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee data security absolutely or unconditionally. If you have any questions about security on the Alder Web Services, you can contact us.</p>

                <p class="text-[#58585B]">As an additional security precaution, neither Alder nor any of our authorized service providers will ever ask you for your Alder Web Services password in any email, over the telephone, or in an online support forum or chat.
